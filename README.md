# Welcome to the Sustainability Chatbot! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

Hi there! This chatbot answers questions about Microsoft's Sustainability Report for FY 2022.

Original report here: [Microsoft 2022 Environmental Sustainability Report](https://aka.ms/SustainabilityReport2022)

## Notes:

- This was developed using Llama2 7B Quantized model in conjunction with LangChain and FAISS.
- This enitre solution runs on a CPU architecture and needs at least 16GB of memory free to run the model.
- LLMs like Llama2 need large computing power (read - GPUs, TPUs etc.), so a technique called quantization is used instead, which makes it possible to reduce the size and possibility of running on a CPU.
- Chainlit is a web framework used for creating this bot.


## Usage

- To run this, clone the repo and download the 'LLama2 7B Quantized model on your local disk. The size of the model file '.bin' is around 8 GB.
- In the 'data' folder, replace the PDF with the files of your choice
- Run 'ingest.py' first, and then 'model.py'
